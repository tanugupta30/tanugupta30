## üöÄ Projects
### üå§Ô∏è Weather Application

A weather application built using JavaScript, Spring Boot, Java, HTML, and CSS. Enter a city name to get details about the current weather including temperature, wind speed, and sky status.

### Features
- **City Search**: Enter any city name to retrieve the current weather information.
- **Temperature**: Displays the current temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Wind Speed**: Shows the current wind speed in km/h or mph.
- **Sky Status**: Provides a description of the current sky conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Java
- **APIs**: Integrated with a weather API for real-time weather data

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/tanugupta30/Weather_Project.git]
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd weather-app
    ```
3. **Run the backend**:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
4. **Open `index.html` in your browser** to view the application.

### How It Works
1. **User Input**: Enter a city name in the search box.
2. **API Call**: The application sends a request to the weather API.
3. **Data Processing**: The backend processes the data and sends it to the frontend.
4. **Display Results**: The frontend displays the weather information including temperature, wind speed, and sky status.

### Future Enhancements
- **Forecast Data**: Adding a 7-day weather forecast feature.
- **Location Services**: Auto-detect user location to show weather details.
- **Enhanced UI**: Improve the user interface with more detailed weather visuals.
